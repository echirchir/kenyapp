Kenyapp - Short for Kenya App, is a simple android application that helps people learn more about Kenya and eliminate all the assumptions flooding their minds.

Functionality:

There are 8 provinces in Kenya. You can pick one province from a list and the app will place a marker on the map and zoom in close enough to enable to user to view where exactly the province is located. 

Secondly, each province will display the respective facts and data related to it like the population, languages spoken, geographical location, the city or town headquarters among other things.

For developers who want to improve this app, please make sure to do the following before running the code:

1. Create a project on the Google Console, generate an API key and copy it and add it to your AndroidManifest file (where I show you to add).

2. Import the google_play_services library and add to your project.
2. Add the support v4 library as well. 

Everything should remain the same. You might have to adjust the versions of the API levels - that is your own job to figure out which API you are using here.

NOTE:
You can change the look (UI) by adjusting the layouts. You are free to do that!
